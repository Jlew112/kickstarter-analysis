# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
We are reviewing Kickstart Campaigns in order to help Louise plan her own campaign. By analyzing the historical data, we hope to find trends that would allow us to make a recomendation as to when, where, and what type of campaign has the best chance of success.

## Overview
To overstep some outliers, and ensure relevance to Louise's project, we wanted to narrow down the data. Louise is looking specifically at the Theatre-Plays Subcategory, and has shown preference to the example set by *Be Prepared, Checkpoint 22, Cutting Off Kate Bush, Jestia and Raedon*, and *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Family.* Using these examples within the scope of the whole dataset, we have found some telling results.

## Outcomes by Lauch Date
Based on the data at hand, the Summer Months of June, July, and August had a much higher chance of meeting their goals.

## Outcomes vs Goals
And there is a window of $40,000-$45,000 goal that sees another bump in the success rate.

## Results
Ultimately, the success of this campaign will come down to the dedication of Louise and her team, but the data doesn't lie. Statistically, Louise should set her launch date in the summer, with a reasonable goal. While success is *possible* outside of the summer months, chances are statistically higher during that time. For additional analysis, we should also consider the population in each country relative to the number of backers in the campaigns. If we find a country with a higher density of backers, *regardless of the success of those campaigns* then we should be able to design a campaign to target the population that cares about this type of kickstarter campaign.
